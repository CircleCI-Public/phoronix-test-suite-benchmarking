# phoronix-test-suite-benchmarking

This project drives the [Phoronix test suite](https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite)
to perform disk benchmarking inside the CircleCI Docker executor.

It should be easy to extend it to run some of the other many test suites that exist in the PTS.
